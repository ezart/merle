| Thing  | What does it do? | Hardware Requirements |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| [hello_world](hello_world/) | Not much, but it's a good example to clone to start a new Thing | None |
| [raspi_blink](raspi_blink/) | Blinks an LED | Raspberry Pi, any model except Pico, an LED and a 120ohm resistor |
| [hub](hub/)  | Hub is a Mother of Things, giving a centralized view to each connected Thing  | None.  The Things connecting to the hub will have their own hardware requirements, but the Hub itself doesn't need anything special |
